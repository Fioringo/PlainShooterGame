# PlainShooterGame
This is a plain plane shooter game, made to recreate the feel and style of mobile games.

## Hello

This is the git repository for the game. Here you will find all of the necessary files that you will need in order to run the game. Each version is placed in its version folder, named after the version.

#### Alpha Installing
>Currently works only for Windows. Tested on Windows 7 Professional only.

In order to install the application you will need to download the version folder (example: ALPHA 0-1-3). Execute the setup script from the folder, then copy Mono and planeShooter_Data folders into the application folder.

### Updates
1. Released Alpha 0.1.3
2. Planning Alpha 0.2.1 to be released on October the 14th (2018), which should be this Sunday. Expect better shaders, more installation availability, and more enemies!

That should be it.
